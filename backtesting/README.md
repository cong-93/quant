Back testing

Intro
	Back testing is used for determing whether a strategy is profitable base on historical market data.
	For any strategy that is revealed by analysis or heuristic, we run it through the real data collected 
from the market daily and validate its capability of making profit.


Strategy
	A strategy is made up of three(or two?) components:
		Trading Condition,
		Trade,
		Profit Condition
	
	Trading Condition:
		A set of rules that determine if it is a good time for make a trade.
		
		An example of condition could be:
			rule1: price of APPLE has been dropping for 2 minutes(*minute based)
			rule2: price of APPLE at this moment is less than the price 5 minutes ago(minute based)
			*minute based: only compare the price between the end of two continues minutes
		When the market meets all the rules, it means that this is the right moment for making a trade.

	Trade:
		A trade can be buy/sell any combination of tradable things(stock, option, future,...)
		
	Profit Condition:
		After trade is made, it requires to set another condition to reverse the trade to lock the profit.
		
		In addition, a limit condition is also required for stopping loss if the strategy fails to reach
		expectation.

		This can be fairly simple compared to Condition.
	
Record
	Each trade made automaticly by the machine should be trackable(Condition, trading detail and profits
	Condition)
